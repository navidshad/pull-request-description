# ChatGPT PR Description Action ü§ñ

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

> **üìù Note**: This is an improved fork of the original [pull-request-description](https://github.com/alvarocperez/pull-request-description) action by [@alvarocperez](https://github.com/alvarocperez), enhanced with configurable LLM model support.

Automatically generate meaningful Pull Request descriptions using ChatGPT. This GitHub Action analyzes your code changes and creates a comprehensive PR description with summaries, technical details, and testing requirements.

## Features ‚ú®

- **üÜï Configurable LLM Models**: Choose from GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and other OpenAI models
- **üí∞ Cost Optimization**: Use more cost-effective models like GPT-4o-mini or GPT-3.5-turbo
- **üîÑ Backward Compatible**: All original features from the base action are preserved
- Automated PR description generation based on code changes
- Uses GPT-4o-mini by default for high-quality analysis
- Customizable prompts to match your team's needs
- Supports markdown formatting in descriptions
- Handles large diffs and complex changes
- Secure handling of API keys

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

1. An OpenAI API key with access to your preferred model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, etc.)
2. GitHub repository with Actions enabled

### Configuration

1. Add your OpenAI API key as a repository secret:
   - Go to your repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Create a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Add your OpenAI API key as the value

2. Create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/pr-description.yml`):

```yaml
name: Generate PR Description

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  generate-description:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 2

    - name: Get Git Diff
      id: git_diff
      run: |
        DIFF=$(git diff HEAD^ HEAD)
        echo "diff=$(echo "$DIFF" | jq -sRr @uri)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

    - name: Generate PR Description
      id: generate_desc
      uses: alvarocperez/pull-request-description@v1.0.2
      with:
        api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        prompt: |
          Analyze the code changes and generate a PR description in markdown with:
          - Summary of changes
          - Technical implementation details
          - Testing requirements
        model: "gpt-4o-mini"  # Optional: specify your preferred model
        git_diff: ${{ steps.git_diff.outputs.diff }}

    - name: Update PR Description
      uses: actions/github-script@v6
      env:
        PR_DESCRIPTION: ${{ steps.generate_desc.outputs.description }}
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        script: |
          const { owner, repo } = context.repo;
          await github.rest.pulls.update({
            owner,
            repo,
            pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number,
            body: process.env.PR_DESCRIPTION
          });
```

## Usage üí°

Once configured, the action will automatically run when:
- A new PR is opened
- An existing PR is edited
- New commits are pushed to a PR

The generated description will include:
- A summary of the changes
- Technical implementation details
- Testing requirements

### Customizing the Prompt and Model

You can customize the prompt to match your team's PR description format and choose your preferred LLM model:

```yaml
- uses: alvarocperez/pull-request-description@v1.0.2
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    prompt: |
      Please analyze the code changes and provide:
      1. Impact assessment
      2. Architecture changes
      3. Security considerations
      4. Performance implications
    model: "gpt-4o"  # Optional: choose your preferred model
    git_diff: ${{ steps.git_diff.outputs.diff }}
```

### Available Models

You can specify any OpenAI model that your API key has access to:

- `gpt-4o-mini` (default) - Fast and cost-effective
- `gpt-4o` - Latest and most capable
- `gpt-4-turbo` - High performance
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Cost-effective option
- `gpt-4` - Standard GPT-4 model

**Note**: The default model is `gpt-4o-mini`. If you don't specify a model, this will be used automatically.

### Acknowledgments üôè

This action is based on the excellent work by [@alvarocperez](https://github.com/alvarocperez) in the original [pull-request-description](https://github.com/alvarocperez/pull-request-description) repository. The improvements in this fork include:

- Configurable LLM model selection
- Updated default model to GPT-4o-mini
- Enhanced documentation
- Backward compatibility with the original action

### Development Notes

- The action is built using Node.js
- We use `@vercel/ncc` to compile the action and its dependencies into a single file
- The main logic is in `index.js`
- The action definition is in `action.yml`

## Troubleshooting üîç

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set in repository secrets
   - Verify the key has access to GPT-4

2. **Workflow Permission Issues**
   - Check that the workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission
   - Verify the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions

3. **Model Access Issues**
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key has access to the specified model
   - Check OpenAI's model availability and pricing
   - Verify the model name is correct (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

4. **Large Diffs**
   - The action handles large diffs by default
   - If you encounter issues, try increasing the `fetch-depth` in the checkout step
